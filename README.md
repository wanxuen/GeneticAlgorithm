# GeneticAlgorithm
The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city once and returns to the starting city. It will be impossible to find the shortest travelling distance by exhaustive search as the time and space complexity of this problem increase exponentially. The genetic algorithm (GA) simulates the process of natural selection to iteratively improve the solution in a feasible period. This report covers various aspects of the GA, including population initialization, parent selection methods, survival selection, crossover, and mutation. Additionally, the performance of different parent selection methods (Random Selection, Tournament Selection, and Proportional Selection) is evaluated and compared.
